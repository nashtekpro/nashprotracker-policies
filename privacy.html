    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: Dec 17, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only your email address (if provided) and a unique device ID — strictly for license validation and subscription management. We do not store any payment information; all billing is securely handled by Paddle.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use It</h2>
    <p>Your information is used solely to verify your subscription status and provide essential customer support related to licensing or billing.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All your files and app data are stored locally on your device. We do not upload, sync, or store your personal content on any cloud or remote server.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all app data resides on your local machine, uninstalling Nashpro Tracker completely removes your personal data. For license or billing-related requests (e.g., deleting purchase records or updating payment methods), please use Paddle’s Customer Portal — accessible via your purchase receipt or at <a href="https://paddle.com/support" target="_blank">Paddle Support</a>.</p>
